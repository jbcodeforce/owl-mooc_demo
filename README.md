# OWL Student Online training demo

 EduTech, an online education platform, wants to personalize
 learning for its students. They need a system that can analyze student performance, learning styles, and preferences to tailor the content, pace, and teaching methods for each learner. The challenge is to build a scalable, secure solution that respects privacy and can adapt to different
 educational curricula and standards.
